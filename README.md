# Learning Objectives

Your mission is to build a full-stack application of your choice, demonstrating proficiency in these key areas:

- Front End 🧑‍💻: Written in the tech stack of your company. If your company doesn't have a preference, we recommend it be written in React.

- Back End 👩‍💻: Written in the tech stack of your company. 

- Deployment 🚀: Your application should be deployed to a Cloud provider of your choice.  


This module is all about Deployment! As we’ve learned about it in depth, it would be fun to try out a cloud provider you haven’t yet used!
You may use Railway as it has a robust free tier and works easily with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
You may use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
